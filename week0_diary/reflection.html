	<h1>Reflection:</h1>
	<p>My file system is a mess.   I did productive work for a whole morning and afternoon on Monday, day 1.  I anticipate the second day, HTML, being way easier.</p>
	<p>I'm blown away to see browser sync in action!<strong>  
	The syntax is browser-sync start --server --directory --files</strong></p>
	<h1>Goal:</h1>
	<p>I have two days to make a set of road goals, communicate them to all Genests, and download unplugged things to do.   Can I get the project unplugged by Wednesday 2pm?</p>
	<h1>Notional verbs:</h1>
	<p>I have no idea how to get a Jeckyll page up on Github still.  Try not to think about it.  You're being paid to fly throught these lessons and get to the CSS project for the roadtrip.  </p>
