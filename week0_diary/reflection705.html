	<h2>Reflecting:</h2>
	
	<p class="starboard">Made a mess of the Assignment 2.   It was already sloppy.  And too creative.  And as the <i>coup de grace</i>, I labeled it with the wrong URL, something that I was <strong>explicitly</strong> told not to do in the instructions.</p>

	<p class="starboard">Feel good that you nailed a life-experience investment, showing Meg we could co-plan quite a BC trip.   On the Fourth we hammered out the Vancouver Island camping base:  a muddy tidal flat for two days.  And decided the time-split of Island/Victoria/Vancouver.   And made the major decision: splurge $300(!) on two concluding nights, a four-and-a-half star hotel in <em>downtown</em> Vancouver, as good staging for both seeing and leaving.</p>
	
	<h2>Other:</h2>
	<p class="starboard">  Meg sent cold oatmeal jar with me, a whiff of her swishing around the house in an Indian-patterned nachtshirten. </p>
