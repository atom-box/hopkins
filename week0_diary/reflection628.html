	<h1>Reflection:</h1>
	<p>Amazon books came.  They are very nice.   Trying to keep them secondary.</p>
	<p>Conceptual realization: think of DIV as BOX and it'll make more sense.</p>
	<h1>Goal:</h1>
	<p>Two courses have begun.  Go far enough in Coursera that I can get a refund if neccessary.</p>
	<p>Other news:  Mom:  'Amy so angry.  A crazy drive, avoiding the roundabout and me countermanding her, spastically the whole time.  I was not allowed to accompany them to airport and they left two hours early for it.'</p>
