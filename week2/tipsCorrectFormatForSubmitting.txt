I wasn't able to find your link so I copied your HTML and CSS into blank sheets and had to load it myself (would have been mean to fail you obviously). But just put the correct link next time!!

This is a little off.. This project was a little hard at times, and I had to go through the lectures and google things till I felt comfortable too.... 
All in all though, you are on the right path, and you get most of the ideas, that's for sure... Good work.

You've included the link to your Github repo, not your github.io page to view the actually site that's been created. It's been stated first thing in the assignment to *not* include the link to the code, but to the view-able webpage. In this situation it's mandated I need to give all 0s for the assignment.
